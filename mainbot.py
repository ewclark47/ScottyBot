This script initializes a Slack Bot and a Mircrosoft Azure LUIS project. The Bot
then performs one of various functions based on user input whenever a user in the
Slack channel types @ScottyBot with a message. This script pulls out the pertinent
message and user information to then pass on to the LUIS module and the database 
module. Once the database and LUIS modules have performed their functions then
the Bot will respond based on what function was completed.
The functions that ScottyBot currently performs are:
AddCourse - add a course to a users schedule based on courseNumber
DropCourse - removes a course from a users schedule based on courseNumber
FindCourse - searches available courses and tries to match what the user is requesting
ViewSchedule - displays the users current schedule
